'AuctionSystem' is the project directory. 

Specification of the online auction service:
1. The online auction service allows users to submit items for auction and to bid for items that are being auctioned.
2. Users must be registered with the system in order to be able to submit items for auction and in order to place bids. Thus, a user can take both seller and bidder roles. The userâ€™s name, status, login id and password are recorded. User status records feedback given to the user by other users, and any penalty points the system has added.
